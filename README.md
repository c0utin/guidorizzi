Lean 4 is a interactive theorem prover to formalize and explore the concepts of calculus, following the structure of the textbook *Curso de Matem√°tica Calculo* by Hamilton Guidorizzi. The goal is to document and deepen my learning process by encoding definitions, theorems, and proofs directly in Lean, creating a precise and verifiable account of the material. By turning calculus into code, I aim to better understand its logical structure and provide a resource that may benefit other students seeking a rigorous, interactive approach to mathematical learning.
